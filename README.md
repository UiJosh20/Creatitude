## REACT.JS AND NODEJS PROJECT CREATION AUTOMATION
For my MERN STACK DEVELOPERS that are finding it stressful to install all necessary dependencies and create a project from scratch, I have created a Node.js script that automates the process of setting up a React.js project with the MERN stack. The script includes commands to install the necessary dependencies, create a React.js application, and configure the project to use Node.js as a server.

## Steps
After cloning this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/UiJosh20/Creatitude.git

```

## Usage
for Linux users, make sure you remove the files from their folder after cloning and then putting them in your /home directory then whenever you want to use it you can just type this in your console:

```
chmod u+x create_vite.sh
./create_vite.sh

```

for Windows users, make sure you remove the files from their folder after cloning and then putting them in your desktop directory then whenever you want to use it you can just click on the bat file

## Features
- Create a React.js application with the MERN stack.
- Install the necessary dependencies for the project.
- Configure the project to use Node.js as a server.
